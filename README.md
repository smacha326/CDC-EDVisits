# CDC-EDVisits
This was a personal project I created using CDC data regarding emergency department visits in the United States. The time period the data was collected was 2016-2022. 
##  Project Summary

- **Goal:** Understand which groups in the U.S. are more or less likely to visit the emergency department over time
- **Tools Used:** Power BI, Excel/CSV
- **Data Source:** Public CDC dataset on ED visits (2016–2022)
- **Data Cleaning:** I simplified the original dataset to focus on key fields like year, subgroup, region, and estimate of visits

##  Key Insights

- **Most likely to visit ED:**  
  Non-Hispanic Black females aged **65+ in the South**
  
- **Least likely to visit ED:**  
  Non-Hispanic Other males aged **45–64 in the Northeast**

These trends may point to disparities in healthcare access, chronic illness rates, or other environmental factors.
